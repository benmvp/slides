NOTES:
- My name is Ben Ilegbodu
- Talking about how we can accomplish isomorphic/universal react w/o a Node backend
- Posted link to slides on twitter if you want to follow along

=====

## What this talk is **not** about... üòû

<br />

- Why to use React
- How to build a React app
- Implementation details in code

NOTES:
- Focusing mainly on high-level implementation instead of all of the implementation details

/////

## What this talk is about! üòÑ

<br />

- "Isomorphic React" sans Node*
- Architecture design

NOTES:
- "Isomorphic JavaScript" or "Isomorphic React" is the idea of using the same templates rendered client-side on the server
- Eventbrite had to solve the problem of rendering React components server-side on non-Node web server
- Hoping our experiences, both good & bad, will help you if you find yourself in the same boat

NOTES:
- Currently a Senior UI Engineer at Eventbrite
- Eventbrite is an online ticketing & events platform
- Many conferences & events use it for registration
- I work on our Frontend Platform team and we're wrapping up a huge push to transition from Backbone/Marionette to... React

### Isomorphic React

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-around;">

    <div>
		<h2>Performance</h2>
        <h2>SEO</h2>
    </div>
</div>

NOTES:
- Transitioned to React
- Isomorphic JavaScript is the concept of sharing the same templates rendered in the browser on the server for initial load
- Isomorphic React is rendering our React app components server-side
- Server-side rendering is important & critical for the transition to be viable
- Performance: initial page render
- SEO: google includes page render speed in ranking algorithm
- React, unlike other JS frameworks/libraries, is setup to render server-side, as we'll see

/////

![Node.js logo](../../img/react-sans-node/nodejs-black.png)
<!-- .element: style="border: 0; background: none; margin: 0; box-shadow: none; height: auto; width: 50%" -->

NOTES:
- Node is needed to render React components server-side because we need a full-fledged JS interpreter
- Typically, with "Isomorphic React" you would have a Node/Express web server
- With help of routing lib like `react-router`, render components to a string included in HTML response
- Normally components are just (efficiently) rendered to the DOM client-side
- BUT Because Eventbrite has existed for a decade, our backend isn‚Äôt Node

<!-- .element: style="border: 0; background: none; margin: 0; box-shadow: none; height: auto; width: 45%" -->

### (python)

NOTES:
- We use Python/Django for our back-end web server
- And it obviously can't interpret JS
- Question: how do we render React components?
- _Anybody else use Python/Django?_

</div>

([pybars](https://github.com/wbond/pybars3))

NOTES:
- Currently solved the ‚Äúdual rendering issue‚Äù using a lib called Pybars
- Our JS templates are written in Handlebars & Pybars converts the Handlebars into Python functions that return a string
- It's like what happens in the original JS
- Except it's super-duper slow because it was poorly written
- Same solution wouldn‚Äôt work for React; you‚Äôd essentially need to recreate Node in Python
- Although we did consider it for a few seconds
- This problem isn't just for Python/Django, it exists for all non-Node back-ends

![Baby no no no!](../../img/giphy/baby-no.gif)
<!-- .element: style="width: 33%" -->

NOTES:
- Answer: switch to Node!
- OPS would've immediately shot down any notion of replacing Django w/ a Node/Express web server
- Not because Node/Express is bad
- Unfamiliar for Ops. Frontend developers are familiar, but they'd actually have to maintain these servers for critical pages
- We still have the typical legacy ball-of-mud huge app in our Django layer
- Working on factoring out things to SOA, but it's a lot! Long process
- Would have to replicate a lot of legacy logic in our Node server that's in Django
- Already making a huge ‚Äúgamble‚Äù with React in general

/////

![Confused Urkel](../../img/giphy/confused-urkel.gif)
<!-- .element: style="width: 75%" -->

NOTES:
- Web server **must** be Django (for OPS)
- Server-side rendering of React **must** be Node (for JS)

        />
    </div>
</div>

NOTES:
- Really this should be the diagram because the Node/Express server is tiny because it's really a rendering service
- Lemme walk through some pseudocode to explain the architecture at a high level

=====

## "Stateless" Render Server

```sh
REQUEST:
- URL endpoint
    ex. http://localhost:9009/render
- Path to React component
    ex. /www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx
- Component props
    ex. {name: 'Ben'}

RESPONSE:
- Rendered markup
    ex. <div data-reactid="1">Hello Ben!</div>
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- It's an internal service that given a React component and its props it'll return a string of rendered markup
- No AJAX, on DB calls, no environment lookup, etc.
- Everything must be passed in
- "Stateless" because the server has access to the file system of all React components which _is_ state

/////

## React Component

```js
// www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx

const HelloWorld = ({name}) => (
    <div>Hello {name}!</div>
);
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Say for example we had this sample React `HelloWorld` component
- It takes a `name` prop and renders a `<div>` with some text

/////

## cURL Request

`````sh
$> curl
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -X POST
  -d '{"path":"/www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx",props:{name:"Ben"}}'
  http://localhost:9009/render

<div data-reactid="1">Hello Ben!</div>
`````
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- If reading cURL requests are your thing...
- Here's what the request/response looks like

/////

## Express Server

```js
// services/react-render-server/server.js
app.post('/render', (req, res) => {
    var params = req.body;

    // Dynamic require to retrieve React component
    var Component = require(params.path);

    // Create element from component & props
    var element = React.createElement(Component, params.props);

    // Render element to a markup string
    var markup = ReactDomServer.renderToString(element);

    res.send(markup);
});
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Digging deeper here's the super simple Express app
- Has a `/render` route
- Create the Component class from the specified component path by using `require()`
- Create an element applying the props to the Component class
- Leveraging React's [`renderToString`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#reactdomserver.rendertostring) to get the markup
- Because React is a declarative tree, we can turn our JS into a string! Most previous libs couldn't do this
- Return it as the response
- Of course there are many more implementation details (some of which I'll mention). But that's the gist

/////

## Running Render Server

```sh
$> node server.js --verbose

[2016-10-18T21:39:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
[2016-10-18T21:40:23] Request for /www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- With the initial proof-of-concept running the render server was this simple
- Message would be written to console that said when the server started up
- We'd run that cURL script from before in another terminal and we'd get back the response

/////

## Django View

```python
component_props = {
    # Data coalesced from DB / SOA calls
    # Data coalesced from Django GET/POST params
    # Data coalesced from environment params
}

react_response = requests.post(
    render_server_url,
    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    data=json_encoder({
        'props': component_props,
        'path': component_path,
    }))

context['react_page_markup'] = react_response.text
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- The Python/Django code that renders the template makes the POST with the path & props
- Coalesce data directly from DB/SOA calls, Django request / environment params
- EVERYTHING must be passed because it's "statless"
- Again this is a simplification of what's going on
- It gets the markup response and adds it to the context for the template to render

/////

## HTML template

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Eventbrite</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="app">${ react_page_markup }</div>
        <script src="dist/react_bundle.js" />
    </body>
</html>
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- So the HTML template page scaffolding may look something like this
- Take the string of markup rendered and inject it into the page template
- We still have to rely on server template (Mako) to render the page scaffolding (unavoidable)
- EB is made up of multiple SPAs so the template is a bit more complicated, but this is idea

/////

## Network overhead?

Yes. üòû

NOTES:
- There is a network overhead
- Instead of rendering all in Django/Mako, we're making a roundtrip to render

/////

### However...

- Django + render servers on same machine
- Single React render per Django page render
- `renderToString` ‚â™ Pybars

NOTES:
- Latency is limited by having both servers on the same machine
- Found that the overhead + React rendering was faster than Pybars
- And we had actually already forked it to speed it up
- Single React render per Django render to limit requests
- Instead of rendering a bunch of tiny components sprinkled, we render the entire page

<!-- .element: style="width: 65%" -->

NOTES:
- That's it!
- So hopefully if you are in the same situation we were, what I've presented thus far is pretty compelling
- No doubt you've got your own legacy code, and there'll be lots of different implementation details for you
- But I did want to highlight a few gotchas/pitfalls that we ran into so hopefully you can learn from us
- The initial proof-of-concept was easy, it was handling all of the use-cases that was the ‚Äúfun‚Äù part

=====

## On-Demand Transpilation (DEV)

```sh
$> node server.js --verbose
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```sh
[2016-10-18T21:39:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word import
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- As we saw before this is how we run the server
- But in DEV we don't want to have to compile JS each time we make a change so server can pick it up
- We need the React component and all its dependencies, all written in ES6, transpiled
- Otherwise we get this sort of error when trying to request a component's markup
- We need "live" transpilation

/////

## On-Demand Transpilation (DEV)

```sh
$> babel-node server.js --verbose
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```sh
[2016-10-18T21:39:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
[2016-10-18T21:40:23] Request for /www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([`babel-node`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli#babel-node))

NOTES:
- `babel-node` was the obvious choice
- Alternate node CLI which will compile ES6 code before script runs
- Only run in DEV!!!
- `babel-node` was fine until I tackled the next issue

=====

## Server restart (DEV)

```js
// Dynamic require to retrieve React component
var Component = require(params.path);
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

<br />

```sh
$> supervisor --watch js/react --extensions jsx --exec babel-node
    -- server.js --verbose
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```sh
Starting child process with 'babel-node server.js --verbose'
Watching directory '/www/js/react' for changes.
[2016-10-18T21:39:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
crashing child
Starting child process with 'babel-node server.js --verbose'
Error: listen EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:9009
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([`node-supervisor`](https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor))

NOTES:
- Once a node module is `require`d it‚Äôs ‚Äúcached‚Äù for the lifetime of program execution (w/o hackery)
- In order to see file updates, we needed to watch for changes and restart the server
- Used the library `node-supervisor` for this
- But when I modified a file the server would crash with an address-in-use error
- As it turns out the problem was with `babel-node`. It didn't coexist well with `node-supervisor`

/////

## Server restart (DEV)

```sh
$> supervisor --watch /www/js/react --extensions jsx
    -- --require babel-register -- server.js --verbose
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```sh
Starting child process with 'node --require babel-register -- server.js --verbose'
Watching directory '/www/js/react' for changes.
[2016-10-18T21:39:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
crashing child
Starting child process with 'node --require babel-register -- server.js --verbose'
[2016-10-18T21:41:55] Started server at http://127.0.0.1:9009
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([`babel-register`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/) require hook)

NOTES:
- After much googling & StackOverflow-ing, found the `--require` flag on node CLI
- Could use it to require `babel-register` which is a require hook for transpiling everything that gets `require`d
- It worked beautifully
- But then there was _another_ problem...

/////

## Server restart (DEV)

```sh
$> supervisor
    --watch /www/js/react
    --extensions jsx
    --poll-interval 5000
    -- --require babel-register -- server.js --verbose
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

Long-polling needed for NFS in Vagrant Docker

NOTES:
- Everything worked great when I was developing the server locally on my Mac
- But once I ran it in our Vagrant Docker environment the server wasn't restarting on file changes
- This is because the file system was NFS and doesn't support file modified event (`inotify`)
- So we had to resort to long polling
- Really unfortunate because it's hard to know when the server will restart
- Will be fixed once we switch away to Docker Machine

=====

## `node_modules` weight

![Mr. Burns can't push heavy bowling ball](../../img/giphy/mr-burns-bowling-ball-too-heavy.gif)
<!-- .element: style="width: 50%" -->

`node_modules` added 1GB+ on servers!

NOTES:
- With require.js we pre-built app JS bundles so we never needed `node_modules` on our production servers.
- App bundles got built on build servers and we deleted `node_modules` before copying files over to production
- This obviously broke server-side rendering
- First attempt was to just let all the `node_modules` through, and OPS complained about 1GB+ additional size.
- Mainly a problem because the file transfer would take much longer.
- Eventbrite‚Äôs package.json has 75+ dependencies which all have dependencies
- NPM 3 / Yarn de-duping would fix that
- Second attempt was to whitelist the few packages we need we needed for server-side rendering. Of course that whitelist continued to grow.

=====

## `gettext` Translations

```js
// www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx

const HelloWorld = ({name}) => (
    <div>Hello {name}!</div>
);
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- As a reminder, this is what our Component looked like
- But Eventbrite is a global company and we support languages other than English

/////

## `gettext` Translations

```js
// www/js/react/HelloWorld.jsx

import gettext from 'gettext';

const HelloWorld = ({name}) => {
    let message = gettext('Hello %(name)s!', {name});

    return (<div>{message}</div>);
};
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html))

NOTES:
- So the code would look more like this using a `gettext` helper
- `gettext` is a unix command that's been ported to other languages
- It's in our python code and we've written our own version in JavaScript
- `gettext` was assigned to global scope by a `<script>` that actually hit a Django view that returned back JS containing translation strings for the appropriate locale
- So it actually relied on the language context in Django
- Need to keep the call exactly the same so it can coexist with all the other JS code
- The render server is "stateless" so it needs everything passed in for server rendering

/////

## `gettext` Translations

```python
component_props = { }

react_response = requests.post(
    render_server_url,
    headers={
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Accept-Language': get_language(),
    },
    data=json_encoder({
        'props': component_props,
        'path': component_path,
    }))

context['react_page_markup'] = react_response.text
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- First step was to pass the language from Django via `Accept-Language` header

/////

## `gettext` Translations

```js
app.post('/render', (req, res) => {
    addTranslationHelpers(req);
    // retrieve component & return markup
});
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```js
function addTranslationHelpers(req) {
    var language = /* from req */,
        translations = getTranslations();

    requestContext.set(
        'request:gettext',
        translations['dgettext'].bind(translations, language)
    );
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([`node-gettext`](https://github.com/alexanderwallin/node-gettext) | [`request-context`](https://github.com/michaelkrone/request-context))

NOTES:
- Using the `node-gettext` library we pull in all the translations from `*.mo` files on the file system
- Then using the `request-context` library we add a curried `gettext` function (from `node-gettext`) that has the language baked in
- Need to use `requestContext` because we want the function to be global, but only for the request

/////

## `gettext` Translations

```js
(function(global) {
  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
    define(function() { return global.gettext; });
  } else if (typeof module === 'object' &&& module.export) {
    var requestContext = require('request-context');

    // server-side uses gettext stored in request context
    module.exports = function gettext(msgId) {
      var gettextHelper = requestContext.get('request:gettext');
      return gettextHelper(msgId);
    }
  }
})(this);
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

([UMD - Universal Module Definition](https://github.com/umdjs/umd))

NOTES:
- Finally converted our `gettext` shim to be UMD
- The AMD case (which requirejs uses) pulls from `window.gettext`
- Now the CommonJS format (which Node uses) pulls from the `reqest-context`

=====

## Path to Production

- Health check w/ `/ping` endpoint
- Log file writing with [`node-bunyan`](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) error logging with [`raven-node`](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-node) & [`bunyan-sentry-stream`](https://github.com/transcovo/bunyan-sentry-stream)
- Render performance monitoring with [Grafana + Graphite](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/graphite/)
- Load testing with [Locust](http://locust.io/)
- Running in QA

NOTES:
- In order for the render server to move from a proof of concept to a production-ready, needed logging & monitoring
- As a UI Engineer all of what I've described was already out of my comfort zone
- Logging & monitoring was even further outside my expertise
- Thankfully I had some AMAZING back-end engineers who volunteered to help me take it to completion
- Decided for the first consumers of new React platform to be new features
- They are currently in QA

NOTES:
- Looks like Airbnb & us were trying to solve the same problem at roughly the same time
- They open-sourced Hypernova which is basically all that I described in late May. We started in late January
- Creating the server isn't complicated at all, but it's a bit complex with little details here in there
- If you don't want to go through the hassle, I'd recommending checking out Hypernova
