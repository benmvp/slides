NOTES:
- Beyond excited to be giving the CLOSING KEYNOTE here at Nodevember
- Truly an honor
- Because 2 years ago I was novice speaker hoping for a chance
- Had such a great time sharing about ES6 and learn so much
- And now I'm back

## What this talk is **not** about... ðŸ˜ž

<br />

- Intro to React
- React is better than _X_
- React ðŸ’• fest

NOTES:
- The goal of this talk is not to teach you React, so you can go off and build the next app that's gonna change the game
- Even if I wanted to, not possible in an hour
- Also not gonna be framework bashing; talking about how React is better than Angular or Vue
- Although I am basically saying it's better than Backbone since switched
- Lastly, not gonna be a React love-fest
- There's no perfect framework; there are trade-offs and I'll point them out
- So hopefully if you're still investigating, you'll get a somewhat balanced opinion

## What this talk is about! ðŸ˜„

<br />

- Rationales explained in code
- For everyone!
- Shameless plugs

NOTES:
- Wanna walk through the many reasons why we made the switch
- But not just talk about; I want to demonstrate it w/ code
- Also, given that this is a keynote for everyone I wanted to make it useful to everyone
- So if you've never used React, it should be a good primer
- But if you're hardcore React, hopefully I can hit you w/ some tips
- Heads up!
- I've had the opportunity now to speak about a variety of different React topics over the last year
- Throughout the talk I'll be giving shameless plugs to those talks
- Forewarning you now, so you can get all of your eye rolls out early

# Stand Up!
<!-- .element: style="-webkit-text-stroke: black 4px; color: white" -->

NOTES:
- But first, would like everyone to stand up!
- Let's do some wall sits
- Let's roll our shoulders
- Let's stretch our arms
- Now turn to your neighbors, introduce yourself & say hi
- You don't realize it, but I just tricked you
- Now you can't say that you didn't get anything out of my talk
- You at least got two things:
- Exercise & and met some people you didn't know
- But hopefully you'll get more out of the talk!

# Why choose React?

NOTES:
- Let's jump right in

[![Tweet from Jordan Harband about how people are hard](../../img/why-react/jordan-harband-people-are-hard.png)](https://twitter.com/ljharb/status/927606717793296384)

NOTES:
- I've been in the industry for about a dozen years
- And I've come to realize that software development isn't just the code you commit
- There's an equal human element to it
- Whenever doing something buy-in is equally as important as the technical approach
- When difficulties arise, the difference between folks complaining or rallying to find a solution, is buy-in
- We had tried React a couple of times, ran into issues, and people threw out the baby w/ the bathwater
- So this time, in early 2016, I put together a loooong document to explain why our Frontend Platform team thought we should make the switch
- The rest of the talk is a talk-friendly distillation of that doc
