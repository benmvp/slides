November 28, 2017  

NOTES:
- My name is Ben Ilegbodu
- Here to pull back the covers on how Eventbrite decided to make the switch from Backbone to React
- Posted link to slides on twitter if you want to follow along

[![Tweet about Nodevember being my first talk](../../img/why-react/nodevember-first-talk-tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/benmvp/status/626294349148483584)

NOTES:
- Beyond excited to be giving the CLOSING KEYNOTE here at Nodevember
- Truly an honor
- Because 2 years ago I was novice speaker hoping for a chance
- Had such a great time sharing about ES6 and learn so much
- And now I'm back

=====

## What this talk is **not** about... ðŸ˜ž

<br />

- Intro to React
- React is better than _X_
- React ðŸ’• fest

NOTES:
- The goal of this talk is not to teach you React, so you can go off and build the next app that's gonna change the game
- Even if I wanted to, not possible in an hour
- Also not gonna be framework bashing; talking about how React is better than Angular or Vue
- Although I am basically saying it's better than Backbone since switched
- Lastly, not gonna be a React love-fest
- There's no perfect framework; there are trade-offs and I'll point them out
- So hopefully if you're still investigating, you'll get a somewhat balanced opinion

/////

## What this talk is about! ðŸ˜„

<br />

- Rationales explained in code
- For everyone!
- Shameless plugs

NOTES:
- Wanna walk through the many reasons why we made the switch
- But not just talk about; I want to demonstrate it w/ code
- Also, given that this is a keynote for everyone I wanted to make it useful to everyone
- So if you've never used React, it should be a good primer
- But if you're hardcore React, hopefully I can hit you w/ some tips
- And if not this can be an example of how to explain besides "it's awesome"
- Heads up!
- I've had the opportunity now to speak about a variety of different React topics over the last year
- Throughout the talk I'll be giving shameless plugs to those talks
- Forewarning you now, so you can get all of your eye rolls out early

# Stand Up!
<!-- .element: style="-webkit-text-stroke: black 4px; color: white" -->

NOTES:
- But first, would like everyone to stand up!
- Let's do some wall sits
- Let's roll our shoulders
- Let's stretch our arms
- Now turn to your neighbors, introduce yourself & say hi
- You don't realize it, but I just tricked you
- Now you can't say that you didn't get anything out of my talk
- You at least got two things:
- Exercise & and met some people you didn't know
- But hopefully you'll get more out of the talk!

# Why choose React?

NOTES:
- Let's jump right in

/////

[![Tweet from Jordan Harband about how people are hard](../../img/why-react/jordan-harband-people-are-hard.png)](https://twitter.com/ljharb/status/927606717793296384)

NOTES:
- I've been in the industry for about a dozen years
- And I've come to realize that software development isn't just the code you commit
- There's an equal human element to it
- Whenever doing something buy-in is equally as important as the technical approach
- When difficulties arise, the difference between folks complaining or rallying to find a solution, is buy-in
- We had tried React a couple of times, ran into issues, and people threw out the baby w/ the bathwater
- So this time, in early 2016, I put together a loooong document to explain why our Frontend Platform team thought we should make the switch
- The rest of the talk is a talk-friendly distillation of that doc

=====

# Declarative JSX

/////

```js
class Incrementer extends React.Component {
  state = {value: 0}

  _handleClick = () => {
	this.setState((prevState) => ({value: prevState.value + 1}))
  }
  render() {
	return (
	  <div>
		<span className="val">{this.state.value}</span>
		<button onClick={this._handleClick}>+</button>
	  </div>
    )
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Here's a rather simple component
- All it does is increment the value every time you click the button
- Want to zero on the `render()` method which is return this HTML-link syntax in our JavaScript
- Many people didn't like the syntax at first
- But I find it very approachable

/////

## JSX

```js
<div>
  <span className="val">{this.state.value}</span>
  <button onClick={this._handleClick}>+</button>
</div>
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Here it is close up


/////

## Transpiled JSX

```js
React.createElement(
  "div",
  null,
  React.createElement("span", {className: "val"}, value),
  React.createElement("button", {onClick: this._handleClick}, "+")
);
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Here it is transpiled; it's just JavaScript
- Thanks to the power of build tooling (Babel)
- We can write our code in friendly JSX
- But out comes normal JS
- I couldn't imagine building my React components like this

/////

## Collocated markup, logic & data

```js
class Incrementer extends React.Component {
  state = {value: 0}

  _handleClick = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({value: prevState.value + 1}))
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <span className="val">{this.state.value}</span>
        <button onClick={this._handleClick}>+</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- With React, a component contains...
  * Markup (`render()`)
  - Logic (`_handleClick`)
  - Data (`this.state`)
- You can also include styling too, but not trying to start a flamewar over css-in-js right now
- So everything is collocated, which is very different than traditional MVC like Backbone

/////

## Traditional MVC equivalent

Backbone Model & View
```
var IncrementerModel = Backbone.Model.extend({
  defaults: {value: 0}
})
var IncrementerView = Backbone.View.extend({
  template: Handlebars.compile($('#tempalte').html()),
  events: {
    'click .js-btn': 'increment'
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.listenTo(this.model, 'change', this.render)
  },
  increment: function() {
    this.model.set({value: this.model.get('value') + 1})
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template(this.mode.attributes))
  }
})
```

NOTES:
- This is the traditional MVC equivalent in Backbone
- You have a separate file for template (markup), model & view (logic)
- Here's the logic
- THe idea is that we wanted to have a "separation of concerns"
- But it didn't happen in practice; especially as things got complex
- We used `js-*` prefix in our templates to safely reference them in views
- If the template changed, you needed to change the view
- If the model changed, you needed to change the tmeplate, and so on
- As things got complicated, hard to know the effects changing one would have on the other
- BTW - we're re-rendering everytime the model changes for simplicity, but bad perf

/////

## Traditional MVC equivalent

Handlebars template
```
<div>
  <span class="val">{{value}}</span>
  <button class="js-btn">+</button>
</div>
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Here's the template; it's simple enough
- But the templating languages were intended to be _just_ markup, so limited logic...

/////

## Logic in the template

```html
<select>
  {{#each values}}
    {{option_value}}
  {{/each}}
</select>
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

```js
Handlebars.registerHelper('option_value', function() {
  if (shouldShow(this)) {
    return new Handlebars.SafeString(
      '<option value="' + this.value + '">'
        + this.display + '</option>'
    )
  }
})
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- And doing any kind of fancy logic got really, really messy
- Plus we'd basically have to basically learn a new language
- We created "helpers" so we could call functions in templates
- Alternative is to do a whole lot of pre-computation in the view to enable the template to be dumb
- Handlebars didn't even have `else-if`
- So we'd have a nested `if` w/in an `else`

/////

## Logic in React Component

```js
class Selector extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let options = this.props.values.map((info) => {
      if (this._shouldShow(info)) {
        return (
          <option key={info.value} value={info.value}>
            {info.display}
          </option>
        )
      }
    })

    return (<select>{options}</select>)
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- But with React, since our markup is in JavaScript
- We have the full use of JavaScript at our dispoable to build up the markup
- We also have linting, editor autocmoplete, and more around JavaScript the language
- There's no need, IMO, to invent a new language for logic

/////

## JSX is not HTML!

```
class Label extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <label className="is-hidden" htmlFor={this.props.inputId}>
        {this.props.children}
      </label>
    )
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1em" -->

React JSX props mirror HTML DOM properties!

```
let labelNode = document.getElementById('label')
labelNode.className = 'is-hidden'
labelNode.htmlFor = inputId
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- One con or gotcha, is that although JSX looks like HTML, it's not
- It's the `className` & `htmlFor` prop which make it **really** clear that this isn't HTML
- React chose to mirror the JS DOM API for its props which are all camelCase
- And that's why its `className` & `htmlFor` instead of the HTML `class` & `for`
- It's also why it's `onClick`, `onChange`, etc.
- React is pretty good at giving great warnings if you forget or mess up
- Especially with React 16

# Component-driven

/////

## Everything is a component!

```js
class FormField extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let name = this.props.name
    return (
      <div>
        <Label inputId={name}>{this.props.label}</Label>
        <TextInput
          id={name}
          value={this.props.value}
          onChange={this.props.onChange}
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- The sole way you build your UI in React is with "custom" components
- Everything is a component!
- And you build bigger components by combining smaller components w/ markup
- Here we have a FormField component made up of `Label` & `TextInput` components
- It defines 4 `props`, which are how the component is configured

/////

## Everything is a component!

```js
import FormField from './FormField'
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this._handleSubmit}>
        <FormField
          name="fName"
          label="First"
          value={this.props.fields.first}
          onChange={this._handleFieldChange.bind(null, 'fName')}
        />
        <FormField name="lName" ... />
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- You include the component by importing it and then using it in `render()` like an HTML tag
- And you configure the props by passing them in via attributes, just like HTML
- Although we're in Javascript using JSX, the HTML-like syntax should feel familiar
- Then you can combine one or more `FormField` components to create a bigger form component
- And keep doing that until you have a full-fledged app

/////

## Eventbrite Design System

![Eventbrite Design System](../../img/why-react/eds-homepage.png)
<!-- .element: style="border: 0; background: none; margin: 0; width: 85%" -->

NOTES:
- At Eventbrite we created our own component library
- It's filled with dozens of React components big and small
- But it's more than a component library; it's a design system
- Talks about _why_ components should be used, etc

/////

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center">
	<div style="flex:0 0 50%;">
		<img src="../../img/react/backbone-logo.png" style="width:100%;height:auto;border:0;background:none;box-shadow:none;" alt="Backbone.js logo" />
	</div>
	<div style="flex:0 0 50%;">
		<img src="../../img/react/marionette-logo.svg" style="width:100%;height:auto;border:0;background:none;box-shadow:none;" alt="Marionette logo" />
	</div>
</div>

NOTES:
- Component-driven development seems pretty obvious right?
- All the popular libraries/frameworks are component-driven in their own way
- But not Backbone; you simply could not nest Backbone views
- Now we were also using Marionette; an architecture layer on top of Backbone
- The version we were using had Layouts, which could contain Views, which could _be_ layouts so nesting was possible
- But it was not nearly as effortless as what I just showed w/ React
- Configuring the nested views wasn't simple either
- It's the difference between components being the core vs. being an add-on
- We were stuck on the latest v1 version that came out mid-2014; think about how JS has changed since then

/////

## Explicitly passing data DOWN the tree

`App.js`
```
<NameForm fields={ ... } />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`NameForm.js`
```
<FormField name="first" value={props.fields.first} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`FormField.js`
```
<TextInput value={props.value} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`TextInput.js`
```
<input type="text" value={props.value} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- It's not all sunshine & roses; at least not for everyone
- If in my `App` I want to set the value of the HTML input for the first name...
- I pass it from `App` -> `NameForm` -> `FormField` -> `TextInput` that reners `<input>`
- This is _very_ explicit; you can clearly see how data flows down the component hierarchy
- I personally don't have a problem with it because I prefer the clarity; especially in code reviews
- But some find it verbose. If they could, they'd rather jump levels of the hierarchy to get it where it should
- But I've seen that introduce other gnarliness

/////

## Explicitly passing data UP the tree 

`TextInput.js`
```
<input type="text" onChange={props.onChange} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`FormField.js`
```
<TextInput onChange={props.onChange} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`NameForm.js`
```
<FormField onChange={props.onFieldChange.bind(null, 'first')} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" style="margin-bottom: 1.5em" -->

`App.js`
```
<NameForm onFieldChange={this._handleFieldChange} />
```
<!-- .element: class="large" -->

NOTES:
- Similarly getting data back **up** the tree is also explicit
- Let's say the top-level App wants to react to changes in the `<input>` field
- Well we have to pass callback handlers down the tree as props
- So when `onChange` happens on `TextInput` -> `FormField` -> `NameForm` -> `App`
- In Backbone/Marionette we had global "radios" & components could register channels
- But no enforcement on who was sending/receiving
