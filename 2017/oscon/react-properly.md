# Stand Up!
<!-- .element: style="-webkit-text-stroke: black 4px" -->

NOTES:
- But first, would like everyone to stand up!
- Let's do some wall sits
- Let's roll our shoulders
- Let's stretch our arms
- Now turn to your neighbors, introduce yourself & say hi
- You don't realize it, but I just tricked you
- Now you can't say that you didn't get anything out of my talk
- You at least got two things:
- Exercise & and met some people you didn't know
- But hopefully you'll get more out of the talk!

NOTES:
- I also absolutely love basketball - both playing & watching

NOTES:
- Currently an Engineering Manager at Eventbrite
- Eventbrite is an online ticketing & events platform
- Many conferences use it for registration
- Historically we've just been a ticketing platform, but moving to being an events destination
- I am the engineering manager of that team
- Previously I was on the Frontend Platform team and where we transitioning Eventbrite from Backbone to React
- Didn‚Äôt want to introduce immediate tech debt from people ramping up
- Reviewed dozens of coding exercises written in React which showed how poorly code can be written in a hurry :)
- Instituted from the beginning React best practices (which we modified over time)
- Best practices helped level up our team in React
- Target audience: those who have done a little bit of React dev

=====

## What this talk is **not** about... üòê

<br />

- Why to use React
- How to develop in React
- How to transition from Backbone to React

NOTES:
- Just so we're clear...

/////

## What this talk is about! üòÑ

<br />

- Overview of Eventbrite React coding styleguide
- Lots of code examples
- Fast-paced!

NOTES:
- However!

/////

## Just to be clear...

[![Tweet from Dan Abramov about no React rules](../../img/react-properly/no-react-rules-tweet-dan-abramov.png)](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/760871101526310912)

NOTES:
- These are guidelines and rules that **we** at Eventbrite have adopted
- They are not hard fast rules
- But if you're looking coding best practices this may be a great place to start

## Agenda

0. Developer Tools
0. ESLint

NOTES:

=====

## React Developer Tools

![React Developer Tools Chrome screenshot](../../img/react-properly/react-developer-tools.jpg)
<!-- .element: style="width: 55%" -->

Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

NOTES:
- Before we start looking at code, gotta suggest React DevTools
- It's a debugging lifesaver

=====

## ESLint

<div style="display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:space-around;">
    <img src="../../img/nav-react/eslint-logo.svg" style="background:none;box-shadow:none;border:none;width:30%"/>
    <div>
		<h2>Enforce style</h2>
        <h2>Prevent errors</h2>
        <h2>Promote a11y</h2>
    </div>
</div>

Extend Eventbrite‚Äôs [React ESLint Config](https://github.com/eventbrite/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-eventbrite-react)!

NOTES:
- Definitely definitely use ESLint rules
- Keeps code syntax consistent so folks new to code can focus on code logic instead of code style
- Enforcing style (like no empty tags)
- Preventing errors (using `class` instead of `className`)
- Promoting a11y (ensuring ARIA roles are correct)
-

NOTES:
- It's my hope that, the main reason I do this, is so you learn something new to make you a better developer
- Any feedback would be appreciated!
