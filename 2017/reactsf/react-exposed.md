# Stand Up!
<!-- .element: style="-webkit-text-stroke: black 4px" -->

NOTES:
- But first, would like everyone to stand up!
- Let's do some wall sits
- Let's roll our shoulders
- Let's stretch our arms
- Now turn to your neighbors, introduce yourself & say hi
- You don't realize it, but I just tricked you
- Now you can't say that you didn't get anything out of my talk
- You at least got two things:
- Exercise & and met some people you didn't know
- But hopefully you'll get more out of the talk!

NOTES:

- Eventbrite is an online ticketing & events platform
- Many conferences use it for registration
- I work on the Frontend Platform team and right now we're in the midst of a transition from Backbone/Marionette to React
- Python/Django backend, but using a Node daemon to render React components server-side

# YOU!

NOTES:
- It's my hope that, the main reason I do this, is so you can feel excited & confident to start using ES6 syntax in your code to make it clearer and more succinct
- Any feedback would be appreciated!
