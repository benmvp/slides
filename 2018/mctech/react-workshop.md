# SETUP

# http://bit.ly/react-fun-begin

NOTES:
- Last chance to get setup before begin

/////

## FUNdamental Concepts

- JSX
- Components
- Component state
- User interactions
- Forms*
- Application state*

NOTES:
- With these steps, we'll learn these FUNdamentals React concepts
- These are all you need in order to build anything in React
- Everything else is just more sophisticated applications of these core concepts
- Learning other little things as we go

/////

![ES6 Logo](../../img/es6/es6-logo.png)

NOTES:
- FYI - I'll be using ES6 / ES2015 syntax throughout our time together
- React & ES6 go really well together
- I'll do my best to explain the syntax; so maybe you'll learn ES6 + React
- If something doesn't make sense, ask questions!

# Follow along

### --or--

# Code along

NOTES:
- There are many different ways that people learn
- I actually learn best with written tutorials because I can go at my own pace and follow links
- Live workshops like these help me because I can ask questions and hear explanations
- I'm going to live code building a fake email app and teach React as I go
- I will go slowly enough that you can code along with me; some people like to do that
- But in order to cover what we need to cover, I'm going to move w/ pace so it _may_ be hard to type & grasp
- Won't be able to stop and debug
- Alternatively you can just watch and follow along
- The nice thing is that you can switch back and forth because you have the opportunity to start from any given step
