# TI-83 image

NOTES:
- My first programming language I learned was `BASIC`
  * Summer program in '98
- Used that to build "apps" for my TI-83 calc in high school
- Would type out code in Notepad
- Print it out
- Then type out by hand using T-9 keypad on calculator
  * Wasn't a way to get code from comp to calc originally
- I would've stuffed my ownself in a locker

![Windows 95 Help App](../../img/webdev/win95help.png)

NOTES:
- Started sharing my apps online, and folks would ask how to write TI apps
- So I started writing TI calculator tutorials
- Initially I wrote them as Windows Help Applications
  * Kind of like a hypercard system where you can link screens
  * Generated a `.hlp` file
  * Hard to distribute
- Quickly realized the web...

# Geocities site screenshot

https://web.archive.org/web/20010405113755/http://www.geocities.com/basicguruonline/index.html

NOTES:
- Built "Basic Guru Online" as a Geocities website
  * (because apparently I was a "guru")
  * Geocities was like THE hosting service of the day
  * There was also Angelfire
  * Talking early 2000
- BGO was like a full web application
  * Geocities handled all the backend
  * FTP'd individual files from computer to their server
- **FIRST:** Overall page layout was frame-based using `<frameset>`
  * The bottom frame was fixed height
  * Main section filed rest of the window
  * Didn't get this functionality until recently with flexbox
- **SECOND:** 2 column layout using `<table>`
  * Still "responsive" nearly 20 years later!
- **THIRD:** Definitely created the logo in MS Paint using PowerPoint clip-art + Comic Sans
- **FOURTH:** Trusty-dusty hit counter (broken)
- **FIFTH:** I suggest using AOL to view the page
  * "Should be okay" using Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator
  * Best viewed on an 800x600 res monitor!
- **SIXTH:** Weekly poll asks about internet connect speed

# Gatsby blog screenshot

NOTES:
- Fast forward nearly 2 decades
- Just updated my blog: benmvp.com
- Uses Gatsby for static site generation
  * Basically to generate the static HTML pages I did by hand way back when
- Written all in React
  * Uses Redux, GraphQL, JSS, Material-UI, Algolia, Webpack, Babel & more!
  * All to build a blog!
