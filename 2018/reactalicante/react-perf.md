NOTES:
- Buenas tardes!
- Excited to be here at React Alicante
- Excited to be in Spain; it's my first time!
- Had a fun React/Redux testing workshop yesterday
- But talking about something totally different now


- Was speaking at Chain React in Portland, Oregon last year
- Spoke about React Native + ES.next
- But an attendee came up to me asking me to help diagnose a slow app
- Then 2 days later, Trey Huffine talked about React performance at SF React meetup
- Those plus experience reviewing code were the motivation for this talk

# React Reconciliation

NOTES:
- Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI
  * The `reconciler` makes this possible
  * Keeps a copy of the render tree and compares with new render
- For most apps, using React will lead to a fast user interface
- Don't have to optimize for performance
- But not a silver bullet
  * Number of ways to speed up your React app
  * If you‚Äôre noticing a slowdown, might wanna fix these
  * OR in a situation where you need to squeeze every ounce of performance

# Use production builds

## Size before:
## Size after:

NOTES:
- Let's just get this one out of the way
- Use `NODE_ENV=production` + uglify
- Because `PropType` & other helpful warnings in DEV
- Also decreases the bundle size

React dev tools icon

NOTES:
- Can tell whether your app is running in Production mode with React Dev Tools icon

# Avoiding unnecessary DOM updates

NOTES:
- Touching the DOM is the most expensive thing we can do!

=====

## 1. Impact of `key`

=====

## 2. Impact of HOCs in `render()`

=====

## 3. Impact of lots of data

=====

# Avoiding unnecessary reconciliation

NOTES:
- Reconciliation is React going down the component hierarchy calling `render()` and seeing if any rendered DOM has changed
- Even if nothing in the DOM changes, the reconciliation calculation itself can be costly for large apps

=====

## 4. Impact of `shouldComponentUpdate()`

=====

## 5. Impacts of negating shallow comparison

=====

## 6. Impact of big `render()`

=====

## 7. Impact of multiple `setState()` calls

=====

# Avoid unnecessary calculations

NOTES:
- At this point, getting to just normal JavaScript code
- Probably won't matter unless you're building a DNA design tool, a rich-text editor, full-feature spreadsheet app, etc
- These calculations Could be the code to determine whether or not to prevent reconciliation
  * It‚Äôs just better to just let reconciliation happen
- Could just be code to calculate new state

=====

## 8. Impact of copying objects/arrays via spread

=====

## 9. Impact of recomputing derived state

=====

# Debugging tools

# Recap

NOTES:
- All these can help your app run faster
- But don't prematurely optimize!
- Go and build things!
