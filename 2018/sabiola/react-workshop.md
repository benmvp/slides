NOTES:
- We've got a lot of people here in the workshop
- For sure as we go along you're going run into syntax bugs or other reason your app isn't working
- We've only got limited time, so I won't be able to stop and debug
- The workshop is setup so that there are **Tasks** that we can live-code together and then **Exercises** that you do on your own to reinforce learning
- Going to power thru some of the exercises
- **Please ask questions though!**

1. [Interacting with APIs](https://github.com/benmvp/react-workshop/blob/master/08-api/)

NOTES:
- Likely only gonna make it to Step 4
- That's ok, because that's the bare minimum you need to know to build interactivity in React apps
- Everything is just layers on top of the foundation
- I'm really hoping we'll get to Step 6 because forms have some uniqueness
- If we somehow made it to Stpe 8, I'd be seriously amazed
- There are actually more steps in the Github workshop which you can do on your own afterwards

# Follow along

### --or--

# Code along

NOTES:
- There are many different ways that people learn
- I actually learn best with written tutorials because I can go at my own pace and follow links
- Live workshops like these help me because I can ask questions and here explanations
- I'm going to live code building a fake email app and explain React as I go
- I will go slowly enough that you can code alogn with me; some people like to do that
- But in order to cover what we need to cover, I'm going to move w/ pace so it _may_ be hard to type & grasp
- Alternatively you can just watch and follow along
- The nice thing is that you can switch back and forth because you have the opportunity to start from any given step
