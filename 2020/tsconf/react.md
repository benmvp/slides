NOTES:
**RESTART THE TIMER!!!!**

- TSConf is intended to be framework agnostic
  - Learn all the nitty gritty about TS
- They asked me to do a deep dive into React + TS


- **Slides are available online**

# TS logo

NOTES:
- People ask ‚ÄúWhy do I need to learn TypeScript when I already am productive with JavaScript‚Äù
- Especially since there'll be a learning curve
- I argue it‚Äôs a matter of perspective

/////

# jQuery logo

NOTES:
- Why do people who are productive in making apps with jQuery decide to learn something like React?

/////

# React logo

NOTES:
- They‚Äôll find themselves struggling to do things in React that they can already do easily w/ jQuery
- Manipulating the DOM, for instance
- They‚Äôll be ‚Äúfighting‚Äù React instead of actually building the app
- But once they pass the learning curve, they‚Äôll be able to build bigger and more sophisticated apps AND less buggy apps because they‚Äôre not maintaining state in the DOM triggered by events
- It‚Äôs because they already knew how to web dev with jQuery
- If they learned web dev for the start with React that sense of ‚Äúis this necessary‚Äù isn‚Äôt there

/////

# React & JS logos

NOTES:
- It‚Äôs the same for JavaScript + TypeScript
- Because you already know how to build React apps in JavaScript, jumping to TypeScript may not seem worth it
- But if you were learning JavaScript as TypeScript from the beginning your perspective would be different
- No different than learning JS from the beginning and have to learn random quirks

/////

# React & TS logos

NOTES:
- Most talks on React + TypeScript just teach how to use TypeScript w/ React
- They are assuming you already wanna use TS and just wanna know how to

/////

# Kent's blog post

NOTES:
- But when adopting new tech we should always focus on the user
- The user doesn‚Äôt care what tech we use unless it makes the user experience better (less friction, more delightful, etc)

/////

# Bug photo

NOTES:
- Users definitely don‚Äôt want a buggy experience and of course, neither do we
- Cuz when there are bugs, users are less likely to use the product
- And when they use the product less, they purchase less
- And when they purchase less, we (the company) make less money
- And when we make less money, I (the developer employee) get fired!
- So my focus w/ TypeScript is on how using TS helps eliminate bugs

# Minishops

NOTES:

=====

# Errors

NOTES:
- Most errors don‚Äôt occur when writing initially
  - But when making changes (refactoring)
  - Either 2 minutes later or 2 months later
  - That's when bugs get introduced
- Common errors / classes of bugs
  - `undefined` is not object
  - Variable `x` is not a function
  - Changing interfaces
    - Deprecated features
    - Changed types
- Gonna spend rest of our time showing TS features that can prevent this
- But I also hope to show you that you can prevent errors w/o too much TS

=====

# Anatomy of a function component

NOTES:
- A React component is just a function
- There's nothing _really_ special about it
- Takes props in and returns JSX
- Can be treated & typed like any other TS function
- Use an `interface` to define the props and is type of argument

=====

# Props

/////

# PropTypes vs. TypeScript

NOTES:
- You may be thinking React already has `PropTypes`
  - What's the difference
- `PropTypes` are runtime checks
  - So you either have to render the component locally
  - Or render it as part of a test
- Failed validation does not prevent the component from rendering
  - Errors will as a result, however
  - It's on the dev to notice and fix
- TypeScript is compile-time
  - The App won't even run if there are errors
  - It gets in your way, which will be really annoying at the start
  - We'll see lots of examples of that

=====

# 1. Props must be listed

NOTES:
- Can't be used w/in component w/o definition

/////


NOTES:
- Can't be passed as props to component w/o definition

=====

# 2. Props are required by default

NOTES:
- See lots of examples where React PropTypes are defined
- But none of them are marked as required
- But if you look at the code, the props are _definitely_ required

/////


NOTES:
- Use `?` to denote a prop is optional

/////

NOTES:
- Default props uses object destructuring + defaulting

=====

# 3. Prop refactors are caught

NOTES:
- If you change the type of a value, all the places using it must be updated

/////

NOTES:
- If you change the name of a prop, all the places using it must be updated

=====

# 4. Can't avoid defining complex objects

NOTES:
- Without prop types, it's just this huge object w/ undocumented properties

/////

NOTES:
- Even with lint rules to enforce prop types
  - `PropTypes.object` or `PropTypes.shape({})
  - We're just lazy

/////

NOTES:
- TS is now getting in your way and preventing you from being lazy
  - But also saving you because you have to define _exactly_ what's available
- If object's properties change (in a shared place), compilation will break

=====

# 5. Function props have explicit signature

NOTES:
- With prop types it's just `PropTypes.func`

/////

NOTES:
- Now you have to define both the args as well as return value

/////

NOTES:
- How many types have you change the args of a callback function
  - Forget to change one or two places?
- `PropTypes.func` wouldn't have caught it
  - Just a runtime error

/////

NOTES:
- By the way this is also really great for render props
  - Get to see everything that render prop is passing you

=====

# 6. Rest props are also typed

NOTES:
- Rest props are also typed

/////

NOTES:
- Can't pass extra props through w/ rest props either
- Types have to match as well

=====

# 7. VS Code integration

NOTES:
- VS Code integration for Typescript is üëçüèæ
- Shows errors inline without even having to save and load app

////

NOTES:
- Provides auto-completion for prop names

/////

NOTES:
- Provide auto-completion for prop values (enums / booleans)

/////

NOTES:
- Even shows prop descriptions via jsDoc

/////

NOTES:
- Shows inline errors for everything, even regular JS

=====

# Hooks

NOTES:
- The biggest unique difference with TS + React is with props
  - Because that's the biggest unique aspect of React
  - And really it's just standard functionality for a function
- The rest of React is really just regular TS vs JS
- But let's talk about some hooks

=====

# Resources

NOTES:
- Only talked about function components
- You can use TS w/ class components too although hooks w/ functions are the way to go
- These resources will help
