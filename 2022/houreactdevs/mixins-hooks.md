NOTES:

- Hi everyone!
- **RESTART THE TIMER!!!!**
- I'm excited to be a part of Houston React Developers
  - Sharing about _sharing_ in React ðŸ˜‚
- We're basically gonna go on a 8-year journey with React
  - But instead of going past to present
  - I'm gonna work our way backwards
  - Starting w/ Hooks in the beginning to mixins 8 years ago
- **Slides are available online**
- I'm gonna try to pay attention to the chat as we go, so feel free to join in!
- **RESTART THE TIMER!!!!**

    </div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- React is especially great at sharing UI
- Here we have a `<Slideshow>` component
  - No doubt it has lots of markup, styling & UI logic
- And we can easily use it in two components
  - `Players` component to have a slideshow of team player photos
  - `Teams` component to have a slideshow of team logos

    <h2>Sharing Utilities</h2>

    <pre class="large"><code class="lang-javascript">const fetchImages = (teamId, page) => {

  return fetch(apiUrl)
    .then((resp) => resp.json())
    .then((data) => data.images)
}</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>


NOTES:

- And because React is basically "Just JavaScriptâ„¢"
  - Sharing helper functions is great too
  - Can call API utilities, data transformation helpers (like `lodash`), etc
  - All from within the component code
- Here we have a `fetchImages` that when given an optional `teamId`
  - Will retrieve images of the players for the team
  - Or retrieve team logs when `teamId` is `undefined`
- Keep this `fetchImages` utility in mind because we'll be referencing it throughout the rest of our time

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- But the tricky part is what I call the stateful, non-visual logic
  - What do I mean by that?
- We've got the `Players` & `Teams` components again
  - But this time they are rendering different UI
  - A `<SlideShow />` for `Players`, an `<ImageList />` for `Teams`
  - But `Players` & `Teams` both can call the same `fetchImages` API to get data
  - They both need to maintain the state of images or logos
  - And both of them need to call the `fetchImages` API again when...
  - Going to the next page of the slide show or clicking next in the image list
- So they have similar state + logic but very different UI
- Ideally we'd be able to render the paginated player images or team logos as...
  - A slideshow
  - A list view
  - A grid view
  - Or whatever
  - But not have to repeat the state + fetch logic
- So I wanna take us on a journey of how we've tried to solve this problem over React's lifetime
  - To hopefully help us understand React a bit better

    <h1>Custom hooks</h1>

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Alright enough about me. Let's just jump right in
- I know typically histories start from the past to the present
  - But I want to try going backwards in history
  - So we can start with what we're probably most familiar with...
  - **custom hooks**
- Hooks were designed specifically to solve this problem of sharing stateful, non-visual logic
  - Came out with React 16.8 (in early 2019)
- If you've developed any React recently, you should be using Hooks
  - Let's take a look...

  } = useImages(teamId)

  return (
    &lt;section>
      &lt;Slideshow
        images={images}
        page={curPage}

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 185px; top: 137px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- **ONE:** Here's that `Players` component we were talking about
  - Remember we needed a way to retrieve the player images?
  - Well now we've got a way with this special function
- **TWO:** It's called `useImages`
  - It's a called a "Hook"
  - And in this case, it's a "custom Hook" because we've defined it ourselves
  - And we'll take a peek at it next
  - `Players` calls our `useImages` custom Hook, passing it the `teamId`
- **THREE:** `useImages` returns
  - `images` - the list of images to display in a UI (such as our `Slideshow`)
  - `curPage` - the current page in a paginated list
  - Plus `setCurPage` - a function that a UI can use to change the page
- **FOUR:** `Players` passes them on to that `<Slideshow />` component
- This all seems pretty "magical" to be honest
  - And in a sense, it is
- **FIVE:** The `useImages` custom Hook looks like a normal function call
  - So it has the typical inputs & outputs that functions have to get data
  - And it's separate from the `render()`
- So let's take a look at how it's implemented

/////

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: flex-end">
  <div class="content-overlay">

    <pre class="large"><code class="lang-javascript">const useImages = (teamId) => {
  const [images, setImages] = useState([])
  const [curPage, setCurPage] = useState(1)

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchImages(teamId, curPage)
      .then((newImages) => {
        setImages(newImages)
      })
  }, [teamId, curPage])

  return { images, curPage, setCurPage }
}</code></pre>

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 350px; top: 308px;"></div>
    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 70px; top: 707px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Custom Hooks are **functions** that _must_ start with `use`
  - **ONE:** So we're calling it `useImages`
- **TWO:** It maintains state for `images` & `curPage` variable
  - Using the built-in `useState` Hook
- **THREE:** It fetches new images whenever the current page changes
  - We're using the built-in `useEffect` Hook, which takes a bit of getting used to to be honest
- **FOUR:** Finally it returns the data the consuming component needs
  - `images`, `curPage` & `setCurPage` (the function that updates the `curPage`)
- It's pretty nice that the entire functionality fits on one slide
  - You'll see in a bit how gnarly things will get

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 185px; top: 536px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- **ONE:** If you remember, we also have a `Teams` component
- **TWO:** And instead of rendering a `<Slideshow />` we wanna render an `<ImageList />`
  - Well now we can use the same _type_ of data we get back from `useImages`
- **THREE:** So we call the `useImages` custom Hook like before
- **FOUR:** But this time pass the data to the `<ImageList />`
- So we were able to share the same state management + API calls
  - Across 2 different components
  - And render 2 completely different UIs: a `<Slideshow />` & an `<ImageList />`
- That's the power & ease of custom Hooks

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- The nice thing about custom Hooks over the other patterns we'll see is that we can call them in sequence
- However we still have some issues
- 1/ React Hooks cannot be called conditionally
  - Because it's against the rules to conditionally render custom Hooks
  - So even if we know we don't need to call a Hook because of the value of a prop
  - We still **must** call the hook
  - Buuut there are ways around this and I'll share a blog post I wrote about it
- 2/ The other thing to note is that custom hooks don't render markup
  - For the most part, they deal purely in data
- This is why custom hooks haven't "killed" another pattern called Render Props
  - What are Render props?
  - Well... let's talk about them

    <h1>Render props</h1>
    <h2>(React &lt; 16.8)</h2>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Technically Render Props have always existed in React
  - And they still do now, actually
  - But they were popularized by Michael Jackson from Remix...
  - As a superior replacement of HOCs (we'll talk about those in the next section)
  - This was right around when React 16 was released (mid-2017)
- Let's see how render props compare to Hooks...

NOTES:

- This is already a lot of code and it isn't even all of it
  - But let me try to break it down
- So instead of a special function for our shareable code
  - **ONE:** We have a class component
  - Anyone still using class components?
  - _Chime in in the chat_
  - We're calling it `Images` here
  - This compares with our `useImages` Hook
- **TWO:** It has the same `state` as the Hook
  - But it's defined in the class component way
  - Remember...
  - `images` will be the list of images to display in a UI
  - `curPage` will be the current page in a paginated list
- **THREE:** We use the `componentDidMount` & `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods...
  - To retrieve the images initially and...
  - When either the `curPage` state or the `teamId` prop change...
  - By calling `updateImages()`
  - We'll see how the `teamId` prop is used in a couple of slides
- **FOUR:** The `updateImages()` method is where we make the actual `fetchImages()` call...
  - And set the `images` state w/ returned data
  - `updateImages()` intended to be "private" but back then we didn't yet have private methods
- `componentDidMount` + `componentDidUpdate` + `updateImages`...
  - Are effectively equivalent to the `useEffect` in our `useImages` custom Hook
- And if class components aren't familiar to you
  - Don't get too hung up on the code either way
  - I'm not trying to teach it to you
- **FIVE:** But let's take a look at the last piece I couldn't fit on the screen
  - The `render()` method of this class component

    return this.props.render({
      images: this.state.images,
      curPage: this.state.curPage,
      handleNextPage: (curPage) => {
        this.setState({ curPage })
      }
    })
  }

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 130px; top: 480px;"></div>
    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 185px; top: 594px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- **ONE:** The key piece of a render prop pattern is the function prop called `render`
  - It's a special component prop that is a function
  - Typically function props are callback functions like `onClick` or `onChange`
  - They respond to a user event (like a click) & do something (but don't return anything)
- This `render` prop is a function that takes in data and will return JSX
  - It can actually be named anything, but `render` is a common convention
  - Hence the term "render prop"
  - It's also common to use the `children` prop as well
- So within the `render()` method we call the `render` prop
  - And we pass it all the data the caller of `<Images />` will need
- **TWO:** First we pass the `images` & `curPage` state properties
- **THREE:** As well as a `handleNextPage` callback
  - It's for updating the `curPage` state when paginating
  - Just like that function we were returning from the custom Hook
  - Updating the `curPage` will ultimately fetch new `images`
  - Which will in turn calls the render prop with new `images` state
- For the render prop, the stateful, non-visual logic is...
  - `state` + the lifecycle methods + this `render` function
- So how do we use this render prop?

  - Basically exposes its underlying state to its parent component
  - Which in this case is our `Players`
- **TWO:** You see how by passing the `render` prop a function...
  - `Players` can now render whatever UI it likes...
  - Based on that `data` param it receives in the `render` prop!
- **THREE:** And here, just like the previous examples, it's rendering the `<Slideshow />`
  * And any other UI that relies on the `data` would go within the `render` prop of `<Images />` as well

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- However, there are still a couple of pain points
- 1/ `React.PropTypes` only have `PropTypes.func`
  - So if you use `React.PropTypes` you know that they can be limited
  - For `func`, there's no public definition of what parameters the function will pass
  - In our example here on the left...
  - What's the shape of the translations object `translations` passed back by `I18N`?
  - What properties are in `authData` object in the render prop of `Auth`?
  - Is `theme` and object or a single value for `Theme`?
  - It can be tricky to know without something like TypeScript (which I highly recommend)
- 2/ Also as we can see here... when there are multiple render props
  - Things can get a bit crazy with the nesting
  - With render props the entire UI is nested w/in the function prop
  - So here we're 6 levels indented before we even begin the real UI
- But overall render props worked well for sharing stateful, non-visual logic
  - But Hooks kind took over as a tailor-made solution
- However render props are still useful when a component wants to...
  - 1/ share stateful, non-visual logic; **AND**
  - 2/ also needs to offload some rendering UI to the parent
- I wish I could spend more time explaining these use cases
  - But it'd be a tangent from our topic
  - Plus I still have 2 more to cover
- Let's talk about the pattern that was popular before render props

    <h1>Higher-order components (HOCs)</h1>
    <h2>(React 15)</h2>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Higher-order components aka "HOCs"
- You may never have even seen HOCs depending on when you started working in React
  - Just like w/ render props, HOCs technically always existed
  - But the pattern was first "created" way back in React 0.13 (early 2015)
  - It was later popularized by Dan Abramov before he even started working at Facebook
  - And it became heavily used because of `react-redux`'s `connect()` function
- Render props can do everything an HOC can do...
  - And arguably in a better developer experience...
  - So render props kinda made the HOC patter obsolete
- But let's take a look at them anyway
  - Because before render props they were a way to solve the problem...
  - Of how to share stateful, non-visual logic
  - Especially after mixins were banned
  - Uh-oh! Spoiler alert!

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- You know, let's look at how an HOC was used before we look at how they're written
  - Because the HOC is used very differently than the render prop
- **ONE:** Our HOC is called `withImages`
  - It actually looks pretty similar to our `useImages` Hook
- Except the way we use `withImages` is completely outside of the component definition
  - We pass a reference to our `Players` component to `withImages`...
  - And it gives us back an "enhanced" or wrapped version
- **TWO:** And here's where things get... interesting
  - Even though the `Players` component won't actually be passed...
  - The `images` & `curPage` props in the app...
  - It now "magically" has them to render the `<Slideshow>`
- By wrapping `Players` with `withImages`...
  - The HOC provides those props for `Players`
  - It just needs to render them appropriately
- **THREE:** Similarly, as the `Slideshow` paginates...
  - We call that similar `handleNextPage` callback function
  - Also a prop that the `Players` component magically has available
- **FOUR:** And lastly the exported `EnhancedPlayers`...
  - Is the actual component that'll be used in the rest of the app
- IMO it's all a bit weird & difficult to wrap your head around at first
  - And at second, and third and forth ðŸ˜‚
  - I always found HOCs to be a very strange concept
- But let's look behind the curtain at how the magic is happening, shall we?

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 70px; top: 594px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- An HOC was (and technically still is) a function that takes an existing component
  - And returns another component that wraps the original one
- **ONE:** So `withImages` is our HOC & it takes the `Component` reference as a parameter
  - Remember we were passing the `Players` component in our example
  - Prefixing the HOC with `with` was a common convention
  - It's not a requirement like `use` is with Hooks, but was a convention
- Our Hook was named `useImages`
  - Our render prop component was called `Images`
  - So naturally our HOC is called `withImages`
  - **TWO:** And it returns a new class component called `Images`
  - It's a component class that wraps the actual `Component` we've passed in
- **THREE:** `Images` has all the same `state` & lifecycle methods as with the render prop
- **FOUR:** The big difference is that the HOC **renders** the component passed in
- **FIVE:** It passes along all the `props` passed to it when it's render in the app
- **SIX:** But then adds to those props those state properties it's maintaining
  - **SEVEN:** The `curPage` state that gets updated as we paginate in the UI
  - **EIGHT:** The `images` state that comes back from fetching new images based on the `curPage`
- **NINE:** We also pass the same `handleNextPage` callback function prop
  - Which updates the `curPage` state
- There's a lot more to the HOC code
  - I'm just trying to showcase the highlights
  - Again the HOC is a function that takes a component class and returns a wrapped one

        </ul>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- So HOCs worked _okay_, but there were several gotchas with them
- 1/ HOCs inherently relied on indirection & agreements to work
  - With **HOCs** the only communication is through props
  - But with multiple HOCs & looking at a component implementation...
  - We now don't know which HOC is providing which props
- 2/ There can be prop name collisions if 2 HOCs try to set the same prop
  - Like multiple HOCs wanting to set a `value` prop (or another common name)
- 3/ Lastly there's no way to alter or configure...
  - How the HOCs are composed based on the component's props or state
  - Let's use the code snippet on the left as an example
  - Maybe we only want to add `withAuth` if a `needsAuth` prop is set to `true`
  - The composition of the HOCs is happening outside of the `render()` method
  - So the prop values can't impact which HOCs are used
  - This wasn't always a problem, but it did make complex situations challenging
- But again don't worry if you don't understand HOCs immediately
  - I'd be more surprised if you did right out the gate ðŸ˜‚
  - It's based on Higher-order functions found in mathematics
  - Many blog posts were written to explain the concept
  - Plus you'll never need to write one in modern React anyway thanks to Hooks & render props ðŸ˜ƒ

NOTES:

- So we've talked about custom Hooks, render props, and just now HOCs
- Let's bring it home...
  - Talking about the OG way of handling this problem of stateful, non-visual logic: **mixins**
  - This is React 0.14 & before
  - We're talking early 2016 and before
  - This was the original way of sharing stateful, non-visual logic
- I'm assuming most, if not all, of you have never seen this code before
  - But feel free to give a shout-out in the chat if you developed during these days

    <div class="code-highlight fragment current-visible" style="height: 185px; top: 707px;"></div>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- **ONE:** Here's the implementation of `ImagesMixin`
  - It's just a simple object with property definitions
- **TWO:** the same `images` & `curPage` state are defined in the `getInitialState`
  - Similar to a class constructor
- **THREE:** We have the same `componentDidMount` & `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle methods
  - I didn't bother writing them out again
  - They're the same ones from the render prop & HOC...
  - That retrieve the images initially and again when the `curPage` state or `teamId` prop change
- **FOUR:** The lifecycle methods also call `updateImages`
  - And as a reminder that's where we make the actual `fetchImages` call
  - Which sets the `images` state w/ returned data
  - All the innards are the same as the previous patterns
  - Oh `updateImages` is technically "private" and only supposed to be called w/in the mixin
  - But we'll see shortly that anything could call it outside of the mixin
- **FIVE:** And finally we provide the `handleNextPage` helper method
  - It's **exclusively for the components** to update the current page
  - It's not actually called from within the mixin
- At a high level, it seems simple enough
  - I've definitely hidden lots of the code in order to get the pertinent pieces on the slide
  - Like Hooks, mixins were created primarily for solving this problem...
  - Of stateful, non-visual logic

NOTES:

- And here's how we'd use the mixin
- **ONE:** We used `React.createClass` to create our `Players` component
  - This is before ES6 classes & the React class component existed
- **TWO:** And it took an optional `mixins` property to define 1 or more mixins
  - Here we're using the `ImagesMixin` object which we just defined
- `ImagesMixin` defines the `images` & `curPage` state variables
  - They just magically show up as available
  - **THREE:** And we now can use to pass to the `<SlideShow />`
- **FOUR:** And finally that `this.handleNextPage` helper is called when the slideshow paginates
  - Remember: this helper method was also defined in the `ImagesMixin`
- As you can see there appears some magic happening
  - Kind of similar to the HOCs in a sense
  - It feels like the state is magically available
  - And we have to know that `handleNextPage` is also provided
  - And that we should not use that private `updateImages` helper

</div>

NOTES:

- Mixins had some challenges to say the least
- 1/ ES Classes didn't support mixins
  - This was a biggie
  - The React team wanted to move to using ES classes instead of maintaining their own class system
- They also kinda had the same problems as the HOCs that came after, but different flavors
- 2/ Mixins had the same indirection problem as HOCs
  - A mixin might need the component to define a helper method/property or vice versa
  - The `handleNextPage` method in `ImageMixins` provided is an example of this
  - Our `Players` component relied on its existence
  - Furthermore, when there were multiple mixins it was hard to know where the state came from
- 3/ Also there could be helper method name collisions
  - What if 2 mixins wanted to name a method `handleNextPage` or even `updateValue`?
  - So we would try to namespace the method names to ensure they were unique
- These problems were so bad...
  - That eventually there was even an official React blog post entitled _Mixins Considered Harmful_
  - I've got a link at the end of the slides

NOTES:

- Here's the full implementation of the `ImagesMixin`
- This was the way to go in 2015

NOTES:

- Contrast that with the `useImages` Hook implementation
- Which became the new way in 2019
- There was quite a bit of churn in between those 4 years
  - For those of us who were developing during that time
- But I'll certainly take Hooks over Mixins any day, and twice on Fridays!
  - Makes me wonder where we'll be 4 years from now!
