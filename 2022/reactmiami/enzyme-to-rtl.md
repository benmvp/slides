NOTES:

- Let's start w/ a quick history lesson
- Enzyme really changed the game for how we could unit test UIs
  - It's v1 came out latest in 2015
- Because React separates rendering from flushing to the DOM
  - We can render React components without needing a browser
  - Before React testing UIs required running the unit tests in a headless browser
- It's API Mimics jQuery's API for DOM manipulation & traversal
  - It has a element wrapper similar to jQuery (we'll see in a bit)
  - But it also dug into implementation details like inspecting state
  - Ultimately became its undoing
- **How many people are using Enzyme?**

NOTES:

- But in general everything was okay until React 17 came out
- For us consumers of React 17 it was probably the easiest React upgrade there had ever been
  - Just switched from React `16.14.0` to `17.0.2`
  - And our apps worked the same

    </a>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- The same couldn't be said for our tests though
- While React 17 didn't change any features
  - A lot of its internals were rewritten to set the stage for React 18 & beyond
- And unfortunately the Enzyme adapters relied heavily on React internals
- This Github issue was opened nearly 2 years ago and has ~100 comments
  - And it's still open; the official adapter never got created ðŸ˜­
- The questions of "is Enzyme dead" began
  - Enzyme the API was actually fine
  - But the fact there there wasn't a React 17 adapter made it unusable

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- However, shortly after that issue was filed kind soul created an "unofficial" React 17 adapter
  - The intention was for it to be a stopgap adapter until the official one was released
  - But nearly 2 years and 24 releases later, it's basically become the official React 17 adapter
- I was hesitant to use it when React 17 first came out
  - But it now gets over 500k weekly downloads!
  - I've upgraded some apps w/ Enzyme tests over to it w/o a problem
  - It was just as easy as the main React 17 upgrade
- Turns out that the unofficial adapter helped prolong Enzyme's end-of-life
  - A year after releasing the adapter, the maintainer wrote a blog post claiming Enzyme's death
  - He regretted publishing the unofficial adapter because it gave devs hope that they could continue to use Enzyme
- When the React 18 beta was announced he tried to create a React 18 adapter to get ahead
  - But he quickly realized that it just wouldn't be possible
  - It would require a whole team to rewrite not only the adapter but Enzyme itself
  - No React 18 adapter would be coming

NOTES:

- Then guess what happened?!
  - React 18 finally released last month
  - Lots of excitement & anticipation (it's been a long time coming)
  - There are new Hooks, concurrent features, and more
- But that basically means Enzyme is officially end-of-life
  - We won't be able to upgrade apps to React 18 because of Enzyme
  - Event though React 18 provides gradual adoption

NOTES:

- But it's not the end of the world
  - Because React Testing Library has entered the chat
- Kent C. Dodds created React Testing Library just over 4 years ago
  - Even before these technical issues with Enzyme, RTL had already become more popular
  - If not in raw downloads, definitely in preference
  - Many people have already migrated over because of the better experience (which we'll talk about)
- RTL's guiding principle is that React tests should closely resemble how the web page is used
  - It's API is designed to accomplish that and almost prevent testing internals
- It works w/ newer versions of React because it renders the component to a DOM tree
- **How many people here are using RTL?**

- Because of RTL's different strategy for testing, migrating isn't just search and replace
  - And that's the whole purpose of this talk!
- I'll be covering RTL best practices
  - So even if you're already using RTL...
  - My hope is that you'll learn something new
- Even though I'm biased to RTL, my goals isn't to convince you to switch
  - IMO that ship has sailed
  - We gotta move from Enzyme
  - But I hope that as we see the migration, you'll see how RTL is a nice change

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Shallow rendering is super popular with Enzyme
  - With `shallow()` we won't see the resultant elements because they're w/in the `<Text>`
  - It forces true unit tests because we don't have to know how `<Text>` is implemented
  - It's almost like an "auto-mock" of `<Text>`
  - The goal of the test is to ensure we're passing the right props to the `<Text>` components
- RTL doesn't have a shallow rendering equivalent; everything is `render()`
  - It's a full DOM render
  - We _could_ mock `<Text>` but it's an RTL anti-pattern
  - Instead RTL provides a handful of "queries"

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Enzyme full DOM rendering w/ `mount()` is most like RTL `render()`
  - Because we have **all** the DOM elements we can use CSS selector syntax similar to jQuery
  - Many ways to find an element; it's super flexible
  - In fact searching by component constructor or component display name still works
- RTL pushes us to find things in an accessible way
  - We find elements how user would interact w/ them
  - The most preferred way is `*ByRole`

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:
- So to quickly recap
- With Enzyme we had:
  - Shallow rendering with `shallow()` where it only tested the component as a unit, explicitly not testing behavior of child components
  - Full DOM rendering with `mount()` where it rendered the whole component tree w/ DOM elements _(and components)_
  - Static rendering with `render()` where it rendered out just the resultant HTML w/o the DOM
- RTL gives us just `render()`, which is most similar to Enzyme `mount()`
  - RTL has a different testing philosophy
  - It's better to test the component how the user sees it
  - Not how it's implemented
  - So full DOM rendering is the only way to accomplish that

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- What if we want to see if an element _doesn't_ exist?
- In Enzyme the `wrapper`, like jQuery, is always an object that exists
  - It can have 0, 1, or many elements within it
  - So we can use `.find()` whether we expect 1 element, many or even none
- RTL on contrast has a different flavor for each
- We've seen `getBy*` already and that is when we expect to find a single element
  - It'll throw an error if 0 elements match or multiple do
  - There's `getByRole`, `getByText`, and a number of others we'll see in a bit
- There's also `queryBy*` as we see here
  - It'll return the matching element or throw an error if it gets multiple, just like `getBy*`
  - But if there is no match, it'll return `null` instead
  - This makes it useful for asserting if an element is not present

NOTES:

- So let's quickly compare querying in Enzyme to RTL
- With Enzyme we basically have `.find()`
  - There is `.findWhere()` but it's far less prevelant
  - With `.find()` there are 4 types of finding
  - By **CSS Selector**, **Component constructor**, **Component `displayName`**, and object property selector
  - RTL would argue that the last 3 are implementation details
  - And most CSS selectors are as well
- With RTL we go from single `.find()` to 8 different queries
  - And these are in priority order
  - **Accessible to Everyone** are queries that mimic the experience of both our visual and assistive technology users
  - **Semantic** are HTML5 & ARIA selectors. User experiences vary greatly across browsers & assistive technologies
  - **Test IDs** are the escape hatch. Cannot be seen/heard by users. Better than classes
- Could actually test in Enzyme using RTL patterns
  - But there are several queries (`getByRole` especially) that are unique

NOTES:

- That first example was standard Enzyme vs. RTL
- Things get more interesting when start talking about async testing
- Here we have a `Championships` component that may be rendered on the `TeamPage`
  - It'll list information about each one of the championships the team has one
- When it initially renders, it displays a loading state (`data` is `null`)
- Then in the `useEffect()` the info is fetched & the state is updated
- `data` then will either be empty if the team hasn't won any championships
- Or we'll render the list by mapping over `data`
  - Render info like the year, opponent, the series record, etc

NOTES:

- Here's where it gets tricky
- What about verifying after we've fetched the data?
- With Enzyme we have to switch to `mount()` in order for the `useEffect()` to run
  - There are workarounds with `jest-react-hooks-shallow` or manually running `useEffect()`
- Let's assume we've mocked the `fetch()` request with `jest-fetch-mock` or all the many other ways
- We need to tell the Jest test to wait to run our assertions until **after** the `fetch` has returned
  - Has called `setData` with the empty list (cuz the Utah Jazz have never, ever won)
  - And has re-rendered to render the `<EmptyState />`
- I've linked to a blog post I wrote on how to accomplish this w/ Enzyme
  - Need to create a helper call `runAllPromises()` that will exhaust all the in-progress JS Promises
  - `fetch` is Promise-based
  - Then call `wrapper.update()` cuz the UI has now re-rendered and updated
  - Then we can finally assert that Utah Jazz have never one a championship
- This is simplified with RTL
  - Take a step back... as a user how would we know when we've got the empty state?
  - When we see the "No championships found." message for the Utah Jazz
  - Well RTL has a third-style query called `findBy*`, which is asynchronous
  - It will wait until the text is found (and throw an Error if timeout is reached)
  - So the test waits for all the async stuff to happen and then continues once found
- RTL has async helpers build in which make async testing much simpler
  - It's more similar to browser-based, end-to-end utilities like Cypress or Selenium
  - Again it's wanting to test like users use the component

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Similarly we need to verify actual results to validate the UI
- With Enzyme
  - We `runAllPromises()` again to watch for after the `fetch()`
  - Update because the UI has updated behind the scenes
  - We'll probably validate that the entire container exists using a selector like class name
  - And then we'll want to verify that the correct number of championship UIs have displayed
  - Since the Rockets have won 2 championships, we verify that we get back 2 items
  - We'd probably go on to verify individual information, but you get the idea
- With RTL
  - Again we have `findBy*` at our disposal to wait for something to display
  - Instead of waiting by the container, which is invisible to the user
  - We wait for the `<h4>` "Championship header" that's w/in the container (what the user sees)
  - Then afterward we can use normal `getBy*`/`query*` queries because UI has fully rendered
  - Since we can't search by class name like we did with `.champ-info` for Enzyme...
  - Using "Year" as a proxy in searching by text
  - We could have added a `data-testid` attribute and searched `byTestId` like I mentioned
  - But the key here is that since we expect multiple items we use `getAllByText`

    </p>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Here's the full list of queries
  - Broken up into 2 groups: ones for selecting a single element & ones for selecting multiple
- Single
  - When they all get the element, they return it
  - And when they all get more than 1 match they throw an error
  - The two main differences are for 0 matches `queryBy*` returns `null` instead of throwing an error
  - This is great for when we expect something to not be there
  - The other difference is that `findBy*` will wait until the element appears
  - This is great for async UIs where the element may not be immediately there
- Multiple is the same except it's for retrieving multiple
  - It returns an array when there's a single match or multiple matches
  - And `queryAllBy` returns an empty array
- We lose the simplicity of one method with Enzyme `.find()` and its flexibility
  - Have to remember when/where to use each of these queries
- But that lose of flexibility with RTL helps us test in a more accessible way
  - And the result may be you having to change your UI code in order to be tested
  - Normally that's a no-no; your test framework shouldn't require you to change your code
  - But many times the changes actually make our code more accessible
  - That's a good thing
- There is an eslint plugin that helps guides you to which one to use
  - Got a link to it at the end

  <div class="content-overlay">
    <pre class="large"><code class="lang-javascript">const PlayerSearch = () => {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')
  const [players, setPlayers] = useState(null)
  const search = () => { /\* return fetch Promise \*/ }

    &lt;div className="container">
      &lt;Input label="Name" value={query}

    &lt;/div>
  )
}</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- Let's look at our quick final example
- We've got a player search component
- Renders an `<Input>` child component where we can type in a player
  - Our `<Input>` takes the typical `value` & `onChange`, but also takes a `label`
- A search `<Button>` child component to start the search
- A `search` event handler that makes the API request and updates state
  - And actually we would have this return the `Promise` from `fetch`
  - And the `onClick` would return that same `Promise` as well
  - All to make it possible to simulate async testing
- Then the players data is rendered similar to our async component from before

    <p>Enzyme</p>
    <pre><code class="lang-javascript">const wrapper = shallow(&lt;PlayerSearch />)

wrapper.find(Input).invoke('onChange')('LeBron')
await wrapper.find(Button).invoke('onClick')()
wrapper.update()

  </div>
</div>

NOTES:

- With Enzyme we're back to using `shallow()`
  - As a result to simulate typing in search, we use `.invoke()` on the `Input` component
  - That grabs the `onChange` function prop and calls it with the string we pass
  - This is pure unit testing where we don't have to care how `Input` is implemented
- Similarly to click the button we `.invoke()` on the `Button` component
  - But we do something different here
  - Remember our `search` click handler makes the fetch & updates the UI
  - But it _also_ returns the `Promise` from the fetch, which `onClick` returns
  - So now here in the test we have access to that `Promise`
  - We don't necessarily care about the data, we just want to `await` it
  - Now our assertions after can _(usually)_ safely assume that the UI has been updated
- Then we can go on an verify our UI just like we've done before
- The approach is **completely** different for RTL
  - Remember we are testing how our users are using the component
  - We don't care how the component is implemented and that we're using `Input` & `Button` children
- So to get the text field, we need to get the actual DOM element
  - But RTL provides a convenience query called `getByLabelText`
  - Because we provided the `Name` label we can search by it
  - This assumes that `Input` is implemented in an accessible way with `<label>` or `aria-label`
  - If it wasn't, I'd have to fix it to write my tests
- What's cool is that RTL provides user event helpers like `.type`
  - It's different than `.invoke` or even `.simulate` because it types each individual character
  - With Enzyme we're kinda cheating and sending the last event
  - But RTL more closely mimics user behavior
- Similarly we find the button by role and click it with `userEvent.click()`
- And we can go and verify the players list
  - Using `findBy` because we need to wait until we know the UI has been updated

- If you're still on Enzyme, I specifically mentioned `runAllPromises` as an async solution
  - The **Asynchronous testing with Enzyme & React in Jest** blog post explains it all
