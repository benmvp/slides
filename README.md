# Ben Ilegbodu's Speaking Engagements

Every opportunity I get to share my knowledge and experience with others is a blessing! I'm just getting started with speaking publicly about what I've learned in the realm of frontend engineering and have thoroughly enjoyed it thus far. I look forward to where this journey will take me.

I am open to speak about anything I write about in [my blog](http://www.benmvp.com). I also have plenty of experience not currently expressed in a blog post. If you're interested in having me speak to or hold a workshop with your group, thank you! That means a lot that you find me worthy enough to share with your group. Please feel free to contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/benmvp) or [email](mailto:ben@benmvp.com).

You can also check out my [Lanyrd profile](http://lanyrd.com/profile/benmvp/) for more information.

## 2016

### [ConFoo Vancouver 2016](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2016)

##### Montreal, Canada

#### [Sweet ES6](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2016/session/sweet-es6)

December 5-7, 2016  
🖥 [Code examples](https://github.com/benmvp/learning-es6)

> ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript available in the engines of our modern browsers and servers. Many of its features are just a little syntactic sugar to help make our code clearer and more concise. Learn how to use arrow functions, destructuring, rest parameters, and other sweet ES6 features.

#### [Flexing your Flexbox muscles](https://confoo.ca/en/yvr2016/session/flexing-your-flexbox-muscles)

December 5-7, 2016  

> Building linear layouts in CSS has been hard. Tables are bad, inline-block has quirks, and floats are insufficient. Thankfully CSS Flexbox enables us to elegantly solve our layout problems. While the specification has been around for over four years, increased browser support has finally pushed Flexbox mainstream. Let’s deep dive into Flexbox: what it is, why you should use it, how it’s configured, and where it’s most useful.

### [Connect.Tech 2016](http://connect.tech/)

##### Atlanta, Georgia

#### Isomorphic React w/o Node??

October 20/21, 2016  

> React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces that has taken the web development industry by storm. Its declarative syntax and DOM abstraction for components not only make client-side development simple, but also enables server-side rendering of those same components, which enables improved SEO and initial browser load time. But how do you render JavaScript React components server-side if your backend doesn’t run on Node? Learn how Eventbrite successfully integrated React with their Python/Django backend so that you can do the same in yours.

#### Navigating the React Ecosystem

October 20/21, 2016  

> React just exploded in popularity. But it’s only a UI library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular, Ember or _[insert latest JS framework]_. We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React ecosystem. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Flux implementation? What about handling ES6+, bundling and routing? How does it all come together?!1?!

> Let’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. You’ll get the most out of the session with familiarity with React and its concepts, but you don’t need to be an expert. By the end of the session, you’ll  have a solid understanding of the ecosystem, know which libraries you should prioritize learning first, and confidently build your own React-based stack.

### [Front Porch Conference](http://frontporch.io/austin/)

##### Austin, Texas

#### [React + ES.next = ♥](http://frontporch.io/ben-ilegbodu)

Tuesday, July 19, 2016 at Alamo Theater

> JavaScript is evolving quickly. The ES6 specification was released in 2015 and is quickly being implemented by modern browsers. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis. We can leverage ES6 and functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code.

> Experience with React will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in using ES6 with React. Learn how to write cleaner code using the new spread operator, classes, modules, destructuring, and other tasty syntactic sugar features being introduced into ECMAScript. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!

> We have been using JavaScript toolkits like jQuery for nearly a decade to make manipulating the DOM easier as we create our highly-interactive web apps. New features in HTML5 & CSS3 should’ve made old development strategies obsolete, and yet we’re still using jQuery to do things better suited for HTML5 & CSS3. Why? Well, old habits die hard.

> In this session, let’s look at ways we used to build interactivity in JavaScript and see how we can transform them into more optimal solutions using plain old HTML and CSS. We’ll discuss CSS3 transitions & animations, new HTML5 attributes, and other “tricks” to offload JavaScript functionality to the browser’s rendering engine for more performant web applications. Whether you’re a seasoned JavaScripter or just getting started, you’ll leave the session with fresh ideas to work with.
