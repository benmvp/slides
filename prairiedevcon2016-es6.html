		<title>Sweet ES6 (Prairie Dev Con 2016)</title>

		<meta name="description" content="ECMAScript 6 is the new version of JavaScript and is already available in the engines of our modern browsers and servers. Many of its features are just a little syntactic sugar to help make our JavaScript code clearer and more concise. Experience with JavaScript will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in ES6. Learn how to write cleaner code using arrow functions, destructuring, rest parameters, and other sweet ES6 features. Oh, and don’t worry if you didn’t understand any of those terms — you soon will after this session.">
